# Retail Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using Python. The analysis covers sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and geographical insights. It also includes time-series analysis to identify peak sales periods and comparisons between guest and registered user sales. The insights gained can help businesses improve their operations and strategies.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identifies and counts missing values in the dataset.
   - Filters out rows with negative `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`.

2. **Date Conversion**
   - Converts `InvoiceDate` column to datetime format for time-series analysis.

### Sales Analysis
- Calculates total sales.
- Adds a `Sales` column to the dataset (`Quantity * UnitPrice`).
- Identifies:
  - **Top-selling products by quantity.**
  - **Top revenue-generating products.**

### Customer Analysis
- Segments customers based on:
  - **Total spending:** Identifies top-spending customers.
  - **Purchase frequency:** Highlights the most frequent buyers.
- Visualizes customer data using bar charts.

### Geographical Analysis
- Analyzes sales by region (country).
- Identifies top-selling products by region.

### Time-Series Analysis
- Resamples data to monthly frequency for sales trends.
- Visualizes:
  - **Monthly sales trends.**
  - **Top products purchased over time.**
- Identifies peak sales periods.

### Guest vs Registered User Sales
- Differentiates between guest users (missing `CustomerID`) and registered users.
- Compares total sales from guests vs registered users.
